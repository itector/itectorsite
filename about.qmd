# Eli Project

The ELI project I am currently working on has a website to teach UCSB students (or whoever might want to learn!) about environmental food labels. We hosted a workshop (seen in the picture!) and I helped create this website with my team!

# CCBER Internship

I am currently interning for CCBER on campus and helping restore some of the lands that CCBER manages. It is a really exciting and fun thing to do because there's a lot of adventure and learning! We recently went on a wild radish hunt, seen on the picture on the home page.
