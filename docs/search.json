We hosted a workshop (seen in the picture!) and I helped create this website with my team!\n\n\nCCBER Internship\nI am currently interning for CCBER on campus and helping restore some of the lands that CCBER manages. It is a really exciting and fun thing to do because there’s a lot of adventure and learning! We recently went on a wild radish hunt, seen on the picture on the home page."
